The intention of this project is to have a collection of boilerplate codes to initialize a project. A boilerplate code for example could be an Express.js project for REST API or a clean React.js project or anything you think would be useful to others or is a better way to initialize a project.

The plan is to have a branch for each boilerplate code. So `clean-react` could be a branch or `clean-react-with-test` or `express-with-REST` or anything you think could be useful.


> **_NOTE:_** A better solution for implementation is always welcomed.
